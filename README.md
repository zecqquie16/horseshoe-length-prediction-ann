# Predicting Horse Shoe External Length using a Shallow Neural Network

This project presents a **shallow artificial neural network (ANN)** implemented in **MATLAB** to predict the **external curve length of horse shoes** based on four geometric measurements.

The work was completed as part of an academic coursework at **De Montfort University**.
